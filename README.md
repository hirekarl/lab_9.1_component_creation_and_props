## Assignment
### Lab Overview
In this lab, you will create a set of reusable UI components for your company’s internal component library. You will practice creating TypeScript React components with proper prop typing, component composition, and prop handling. This lab focuses on **component creation**, **TypeScript interfaces**, **prop handling**, and **component composition** using React and TypeScript.

### Workplace Context
Imagine you are a frontend developer tasked with building a component library for your company’s internal applications. Your team needs a set of reusable, type-safe components that can be easily configured for different use cases. These components will be used across multiple applications, so they need to be well-documented, properly typed, and flexible enough to handle various scenarios.

This lab will help you practice building the foundational components that will be used throughout your company’s applications.
